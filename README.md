  - I'm always in for a good cup of espresso ☕.



### 📫 Main Projects
* [`Predicting cars speed`](https://github.com/simo955/Predicting_cars_speed) : Built an ensemble of two gradient-boosted trees models, **Catboost** and **LightGBM**, to predict traffic average speeds in specific times and points of Italian roads.
* [`Trading deamon/bot`](https://github.com/simo955/traiding_deamon) : Independently developed a Python Telegram bot that given a stock symbol keeps fetching in the background the price of the wanted stock. When it registers a suddenly increasing (or decreasing) with respect of the avg of the past *n* prices, the bot notifies the user. The bot is currently public: @trading\_deamon\_bot
* [`Recommender Systems Challenge`](https://github.com/simo955/RecSys_2018) : This competition aggregated the results of 6 different submissions on *Kaggle* over a time span of 6 months.
The goal was to produce a recommendation of 10 tracks for each of the 10k given playlists. 
Independently built a **Hybrid Recommender System** combining both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques using python. *Final position:* 12th over 80 teams (for 5 months in the top 5 reaching highest possible evaluation).
