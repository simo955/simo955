### Ciao, nice to meet you 👋

I'm Simone, a Computer Scientist and Engineer currently working @Mia-Platform.   
I like to interpret graphs, build stuff from scratch, and dream big.

### 🎓 Education
* M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano 108/110 with focus in **Machine Learning**, Data Science, **Software Engineering**.
* B.Sc. in Computer Science at Università di Genova 105/110 with focus on **Software Engineering** and theoretical computer science.

### 👨🏽‍💻 Working Experience
* **Mia-Platform** | Software Engineer, May 2020 - present
  * Designed and implemented Apache Kafka pipelines to ingest data into a data lake.
  * Developed an Home Insurance portal based on RESTful APIs. Many APIs rely on complex MongoDB aggregations designed to be extremely performing.
  * Extended Mia-Platform's Paas with the implementation of different microservices started on customer needs and later generalized.

* **Boston University SecLab** | Research Assistant, January-March 2020
  * Collected and preprocessed more than 1M posts coming from different Social Media(Facebook, Twitter, Reddit).
  * Performed temporal and content analysis on posts containing a news URL to study the dissemination of news on Social Media.
  * Exploited *Hawkes Process* statistical model to assess the influence that posts on a platform had on the content of other platforms.

### 🤔 What do I do when I am not at my laptop?
  - I love to surf 🏄.
  - I often read biographies 📚. Last one -> [Will](https://www.amazon.it/Smith-W-Will/dp/1529124158).
  - I'm always in for a good cup of espresso ☕.



### 📫 Main Projects
* [`Predicting cars speed`](https://github.com/simo955/Predicting_cars_speed) : built an ensemble of two gradient-boosted trees models, **Catboost** and **LightGBM**, to predict traffic average speeds in specific times and points of Italian roads.
* [`Trading deamon/bot`](https://github.com/simo955/traiding_deamon) : (🚨 in progress🚨)     Independently developed a python telegram bot that given a stock symbol keeps fetching in the background the price of the wanted stock. When it registers a suddenly increasing (or decreasing) with respect of the avg of the past *n* prices, the bot notifies the user. The bot is currently public: @trading\_deamon\_bot
* [`Recommender Systems Challenge`](https://github.com/simo955/RecSys_2018) : This competition aggregated the results of 6 different submissions on *Kaggle* over a time span of 6 months.
The goal was to produce a recommendation of 10 tracks for each of the 10k given playlists. 
Independently built a **Hybrid Recommender System** combining both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques using python. *Final position:* 12th over 80 teams (for 5 months in the top 5 reaching highest possible evaluation).
