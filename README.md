### Ciao, I’m Simone 👋

I'm a Senior AI Engineer currently at **Klarna**, building production-grade AI systems and scalable backend architectures.

Based in **Milan, Italy**. I enjoy solving hard problems, building things from scratch, and drinking way too much espresso.

### ⚡ What I’m up to
- **Making AI useful**: I build agents that can reason, call tools, and actually finish tasks without hallucinating (too much).
- **RAG but smarter**: Moving beyond simple vector search to **GraphRAG**—because context matters.
- **System plumbing**: I love the gritty parts of distributed systems—Kafka streams, async queues, and making microservices play nice together.

### 🚀 Some cool things I've built
- **Klarna**: Productionized agentic systems that power real-time user features. Also built a graph-backed RAG platform that **10+ teams** are now using.
- **Generali**: Turned a manual car damage claim process into a fully automated microservices pipeline, cutting processing time from **days to hours**.
- **Mia-Platform**: Optimized a massive data ingestion pipeline with **50+ Kafka streams**, killing latency issues and handling peak loads without breaking a sweat.

> Notes: I also work with Java (services/platform integrations), Neo4j (graph DB), and LLM providers (OpenAI/Anthropic). For streaming I often use **Kafka** (no icon in this repo yet).

### Experience (recent)
- **Klarna** — Senior AI Engineer (Dec 2023 – Present)
  - Built agentic systems that reason, call tools, and execute multi-step plans; moved from Python PoCs to scalable AWS services.
  - Architected/productionized a graph-aware RAG platform backed by Neo4j, with adoption across 10+ teams.
  - Worked across AI infrastructure and pipelines to improve performance and enable deeper user customization.

- **Generali Italia** — Machine Learning Engineer (Jan 2022 – Dec 2023)
  - Designed and deployed a production-grade microservices platform for car damage estimation on GKE (Docker + pipelines + observability), cutting claim processing from **days to hours**.
  - Coordinated with a cross-functional team of **6+ engineers** to design a **B2C event-based microservices** architecture leveraging computer vision models for damage estimation.
  - Led an ML engineering group of **4** to build an MLOps framework standardizing training + deployment, model validation hooks, and production readiness.
  - Built a reusable “Golden Path” scaffold (Cookiecutter) with CI/CD (e.g. Jenkins) and monitoring (e.g. Datadog), reducing onboarding time for new ML projects.
  - As part of the platform team, shipped improvements to internal frameworks used by **80+ engineers**.

- **Mia-Platform** — Software Engineer (May 2020 – Jan 2022)
  - Shipped **30+ Node.js microservices** on the company PaaS; heavy use of REST APIs and event-driven patterns (Kafka), with Docker/Kubernetes deployments.
  - Optimized ingestion into a centralized Data Lake (MongoDB) leveraging **50+ Kafka streams**, improving real-time throughput and stability under load.
  - Achieved **~30%** improvement in aggregation time by redesigning MongoDB aggregation pipelines and implementing parallel processing (eliminating peak-load timeouts).
  - Built a real-time decision pipeline consuming Kafka events, applying validation/merge logic, and forwarding validated changes to downstream services.
  - Implemented monitoring/logging (Prometheus/Grafana) to catch performance bottlenecks earlier and reduce incident response time.

- **Boston University SecLab** — Research Assistant (Oct 2019 – Apr 2020)
  - Built Python ETL pipelines to collect/process **1M+** social posts (Twitter/Reddit/Facebook) over a 2-year span for large-scale analysis.
  - Recreated a Hawkes process model in Python to study temporal dynamics of malicious URL dissemination across platforms.

### Education
- **M.Sc. Computer Science & Engineering**, Politecnico di Milano
- **B.Sc. Computer Science**, Università di Genova

### Projects
- **Predicting cars speed**: [`Predicting_cars_speed`](https://github.com/simo955/Predicting_cars_speed) — ensemble of CatBoost + LightGBM to predict traffic speeds on Italian roads.
- **Trading bot**: [`traiding_deamon`](https://github.com/simo955/traiding_deamon) — Python Telegram bot that tracks a stock price and alerts on deviations vs recent average.
- **Recommender Systems**: [`RecSys_2018`](https://github.com/simo955/RecSys_2018) — hybrid recommender (content-based + collaborative filtering); **12th/80** final position.

### Outside work
- Surfing, competitive tennis, biographies, and espresso.
