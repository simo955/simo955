### Ciao, nice to meet you 👋

I'm Simone, a Computer Engineer currently working as Machine Learning Engineer [@Generali Italia](https://www.generali.it).   
I enjoy building things from scratch, learning new stuff, and dreaming big.

### 🎓 Education
* Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Politecnico di Milano, with a focus on **Machine Learning**, Data Science, **Software Engineering**. Final Grade 108/110.
* Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Università di Genova, with a focus on **Software Engineering** and theoretical computer science. Final Grade 105/110.

### 👨🏽‍💻 Working Experience
* **Generali Italia** | Machine Learning Software Engineer, January 2022 - present
Working in the Advanced Analytics team to build AI solutions and products for internal/external customers.
  * Implemented a high-performance, scalable pipeline on GCP using computer vision models to estimate car damage. Result
  achieved creating a microservices architecture (Docker), based on a Python stack (Flask and FastAPI), deployed on GKE.
  * Created solutions for serving ML model predictions to business users through APIs, serverless processes (Cloud Functions), or
  batch processes.
  * Implemented CI/CD solutions using Jenkins, SonarQube, and GCP services, and utilized infrastructure-as-code (IaC) solutions
  with Terraform to manage infrastructure and monitoring on GCP.

* **Mia-Platform** | Software Engineer, May 2020 - December 2021
Mia-Platform is a product based company which provides a console to manage the entire DevOps Stream and master end-to-end enterprise digital platforms based on APIs, microservices and Fast Data.
  * Designed and implemented 30+ containerized (Docker) microservices (Node.js), often operating through APIs. Fostering a measurability and monitoring culture.
  * Developed and administered 50+ Apache Kafka streams to enhance data ingestion into a Data Lake.
  * Optimized data aggregation time by 25% through the redesign and implementation of high-performing MongoDB aggregation
  pipelines.

* **Boston University SecLab** | Research Assistant, January-March 2020
  * Collected and processed over 1M social media posts from Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook.
  * Analyzed the problem of news dissemination by performing sentiment and temporal analysis on posts containing URLs.
  * Evaluated the impact of specific accounts on the dissemination of content between platforms using a Hawkes Process statistical model structure implemented in Python.

### 🤔 What do I do when I'm not at my laptop?
  - I love surfing 🏄.
  - I often read biographies 📚. Spare -> [Spare: Prince Harry](https://www.amazon.it/Spare-English-Sussex-Prince-Harry-ebook/dp/B0BJV8XM2W).
  - I'm always in for a good cup of espresso ☕.



### 📫 Main Projects
* [`Predicting cars speed`](https://github.com/simo955/Predicting_cars_speed) : Built an ensemble of two gradient-boosted trees models (**Catboost** and **LightGBM**) to predict traffic average speeds at specific times and locations on Italian roads.
* [`Trading deamon/bot`](https://github.com/simo955/traiding_deamon) : Independently developed a Python Telegram bot that continuously fetches the price of a specified stock and alerts the user if there is a sudden increase or decrease in relation to the average of the past n prices. The bot is currently available to the public at @trading\_deamon\_bot .
* [`Recommender Systems Challenge`](https://github.com/simo955/RecSys_2018) : participated in a competition that aggregated the results of six different submissions on Kaggle over a period of six months. The goal was to recommend 10 tracks for each of 10,000 given playlists, and I built a **hybrid recommender** system combining both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques using Python. I achieved a final position of 12th out of 80 teams, and was in the top 5 for five months, reaching the highest possible evaluation.
