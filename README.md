### Ciao, nice to meet you 👋

I am Simone, a Computer Scientist and Engineer currently working @Mia-Platform.   
I like to interpret graphs, build stuff from scratch, and dream big.

### 🎓 Education
* M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano 108/110 with focus in **Machine Learning**, Data Science, **Software Engineering**.
* B.Sc. in Computer Science at Università di Genova 105/110 with focus on **Software Engineering** and theoretical computer science.

### 👨🏽‍💻 Working Experience
* **Mia-Platform** | Software Engineer, May 2020 - present
  * ETL: Designed and implemented pipelines to ingest data into a data lake with Apache Kafka.
  * REST APIs: Developed a Home Insurance portal based on RESTful APIs. Many of them involved complex MongoDB
  aggregations.
  * Microservices: Extended Mia-Platform’s product with the implementation of different microservices crafted from
  customer needs and later generalized.

* **Boston University** | Research Assistant at SecLab BU, January-March 2020
  * Crawling and Preprocessing: Collected and preprocessed more than 1M posts coming from different Social Media.
  * Data mining: Performed temporal and content analysis to assess the dynamics related to the dissemination of news and
  the text content of posts containing a news URL.
  * Influence Analysis: Applied the Hawkes Process statistical model to compute the influence that posts on a platform
  had on the content of other socials.

### 🤔 What do I do when I am not at my laptop?
  - I love to surf 🏄.
  - I often read biographies 📚. Last one -> [Undisputed Truth: My Autobiography](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B00DKEADI2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).
  - Not that much, I'm always at my laptop 🤷‍♂️



### 📫 Main Projects
* [`Predicting cars speed`](https://github.com/simo955/Predicting_cars_speed) : built an ensemble of two gradient-boosted trees models, **Catboost** and **LightGBM**, to predict traffic average speeds in specific times and points of Italian roads.
* [`Trading deamon/bot`](https://github.com/simo955/traiding_deamon) : (🚨 in progress🚨)
* [`Recommender Systems Challenge`](https://github.com/simo955/RecSys_2018) : built a **Hybrid Recommender** System combining both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques using python.
